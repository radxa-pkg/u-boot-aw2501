Description: Disable PCIe in U-Boot for Cubie A7A Router HAT compatibility
 The Radxa Cubie A7A hangs during U-Boot when the Radxa Dual 2.5G Router HAT
 is attached. The hang occurs after "pcie link up success" message during
 ASM2806 PCIe switch enumeration.
 .
 This patch disables PCIe in U-Boot's device tree for the Cubie A7A board.
 U-Boot doesn't need PCIe functionality for booting, and the Linux kernel
 will re-initialize PCIe after boot with proper quirks for the ASM2806 switch.
 .
 Hardware affected:
  - Board: Radxa Cubie A7A (Allwinner A733)
  - HAT: Radxa Dual 2.5G Router HAT (ASMedia ASM2806 + 2x RTL8125B)
